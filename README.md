# 🌙 Nuvian

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔒 Smart App Blocking
Automatically block apps you choose during your set sleep window using Apple's FamilyControls and DeviceActivity frameworks.

### 🔥 Streak-Based Motivation
Keep your streak alive by not overriding your sleep block. If you unblock, your streak resets — simple and effective.

### 📈 Elo Ranking System
Stay motivated with an evolving elo score. The more consistent you are, the higher you rank — from Bronze to Silver to Gold, with tiered levels (III to I).

### 😴 Sleep Mode Status
See whether sleep mode is currently active and understand how it's working behind the scenes.

### ☀️ Breaks Without Guilt
Need a break? Temporarily lift restrictions without breaking your streak using the built-in break system.

### 💬 Quote of the Day
Get a little sleep wisdom each night to keep you centered and inspired.
